Resultados de aprendizagem e competênciasCritical knowledge of the state-of-the-art of the research theme to be addressed in the PhD Thesis. Capacity to identify an open question and design a research plan to answer it. Modo de trabalhoPresencial Programa Specific theme of Physics Engineering that identifies and responds to the needs of production, research, development and innovation of industrial and academic actors of the national and global Physics Engineering community. The monograph will develop the state-of-the art and propose the methodology, framework and work-plan of the research & development to be conducted in the subsequent years of the Doctoral Programme. More specifically the monograph should include the following structure: 1. State-of-the-art | Present the current state-of-the-art of the research field of the thesis. Highlight open questions of relevance to your research. 2. Research goals and step-forward | Present the specific research goals of the Thesis focusing on their originality and step-forward with respect to the state-of-the-art. 3. Research methods (optional) | Present the methods to be used in your thesis. 4. Research Impact | Detail the relevance of the research, its impact outside the specific research domain in terms of societal impact, products and business opportunities and on your employability after the PhD. 5. Thesis plan and environment | Present a detailed plan for the thesis, with specific milestones. The plan should cover the full thesis duration. It must include outcomes, e.g. in terms of papers and include time for thesis writing. The environment of the thesis in terms of supervisor, team, research units and international collaborations must be referred. Refer the PhD funding during the full thesis duration.
